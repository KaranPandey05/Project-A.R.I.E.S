# Project Aries - Carbon Capture Device
Project Aries is an innovative carbon capture device designed to mitigate CO2 emissions from the atmosphere using a straightforward chemical process. It utilizes 3D printed components and simple mechanisms to achieve efficient carbon capture and purification of air.

## Overview

Project Aries operates by pulling air through a series of tubes using a fan. Inside the device, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) mist reacts with CO2 in the air, forming sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and water. The captured CO2 condenses into liquid form and is collected in a removable container at the bottom of the device. The purified air, now depleted of CO2, continues through the tubes and returns to the environment.

## Design and Components

- **Fan and Venturi Tube**: A fan creates airflow through the device, enhancing the intake of air. The venturi tube design increases air velocity, optimizing the reaction efficiency.
  
- **Sodium Hydroxide System**: An electric water pump sprays sodium hydroxide mist downwards from the top of the pipe, ensuring thorough contact with the upward airflow containing CO2.

- **Carbon Capture and Collection**: CO2 reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate, which collects as a solution at the bottom of the device in a removable container. This solution can be responsibly disposed of or utilized in industrial applications.

- **Energy Efficiency**: Project Aries is designed to be energy efficient, consuming approximately 82 watts during operationâ€”less than a tenth of the average air conditioner's power consumption.

## Environmental Impact

Project Aries aims to contribute to environmental sustainability by potentially removing up to a ton of CO2 per month if adopted by 1000 users. The sodium carbonate produced is biodegradable and poses minimal environmental risk, offering a sustainable solution to carbon capture and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
